        <h2 id="Story-1">That Time When My Brother Hit Me With A Hoe</h2>
        <h6>July 8th, 2009</h6>
        <img src="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=80395b6395&attid=0.1&permmsgid=msg-a:r45126490902971302&th=16d833e9199e8867&view=fimg&sz=s0-l75-ft&attbid=ANGjdJ-NeM6fqrzCNaBIw8NLyRkbZ3fk6KMOd5NSW8CJ1gU_V6sIIm_zr6dnU_FWbiIvrW2aOidmEhXG7SZW3mdMdvG_kdUwECdlURMf6HLpGQh2rrif_6q2HXocJBc&disp=emb&realattid=16d833e485b207cf5f01" alt="pic of despondant me at hospital" width=400>
        <p>I don't remember many of the details to this, but the story always gets a chuckle because I was 'hit in the head with a <em>hoe</em>'. And people are mature.<br>
        And I definitely get a chuckle out of it myself.<br>
        What I remember of the expirence, is simply making my little brother upset while we were playing in the flower beds, digging up the weeds with a garden hoe as we did. My brother will say it was an accident, but I remember making him upset and him hitting me with a hoe. And it hurt. So, like the  or 6 year old kid I was, I ran inside bawling like a baby with my hand on my head. My mom wasn't panicked, initially, until she pulled my hand from my head and saw the blood.<br>
        She grabbed about three or four hundred towls, called 9-1-1, and sat out on the porch with me holding a towel on my head to control the blood flow. The EMT down the road arrived and came to help while we waited for the ambulance. When it arrived, they strapped me on the bed and sped off to the nearest hospital. They checked for a concussion, and there wasn't one. I ended up getting two staples in my head that day, and a wrap around the top of my head - that my baby doll also got.<br>
        Also, fun fact, getting staples removed doesn't hurt. Getting them put in however, hurts like a hekkin' hekker.</p>

        <h2 id="Story-2">That Time When I Almost Broke My Ankle</h2>
        <h6>July 16th, 2013</h6>
        <img src="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=80395b6395&attid=0.3&permmsgid=msg-a:r45126490902971302&th=16d833e9199e8867&view=fimg&sz=s0-l75-ft&attbid=ANGjdJ--RYEHb-iPI81qh7-CpcFWwzyGDsuPjfGRfSXRZ8V56v28sNx0xRhI7RXG00DLYBihjdNzpvJ585_pI7QZCuMChoUl5DMQCrvjht5eYSGBwHN7pDPxtZUHtuQ&disp=emb&realattid=16d833e8217207cf5f04" alt="pic of me at hospital with sprained ankle" width=300>
        <p>I've never broken a bone, but really the concept of it terrifies me if spraining an ankle hurts as bad as it did.<br>
        I was messing around with my brother- well, more so that my brother was messing around with <em>me</em>. At the time we were building an addition onto the house, a Breezeway, and there was about 4' holes in the ground. And, as a pair of geniuses, the place we decided to mess around was the area with the four foot holes in the ground.<br>
        Essentially, my little brother was chasing me around with a rake - much to my terror - and as I was backing away from him, he swung the rake tauntingly. I stepped back, and right into a hole I didn't previously see. I fell all the way into the hole, and my foot got lodged in what I can only describe as a 'V' position, so it was bent upwards. One of the most painful things I've expirenced.<br>
        My brother panicked and ran inside to get our Grammy, who was living with us at the time, and she called my mom home and I was taken to the hospital. At the hospital, they put me in a wheelchair and took me to get x-rays. The doctor was surprised to see it wasn't broken, and only badly sprained. Any more stress on the bone would've caused it to break, but it only 'almost' broke. Due to the pain I expirence in my leg on a general basis, I do think there might've been more damage than what was there, but who knows. It's been roughly 5 years since then, anyways.</p>

        <h2 id="Story-3">Why I Keep the Light On When I Sleep</h2>
        <h6>Somewhere around the time I was in 7th Grade</h6>
        
        <p>I understand majority of people sleep with the lights off, in darkness. As it's natural, of course. I used to sleep like that myself.<br>
        I've always been a firm believer in the paranormal; ghosts, spirits, ghouls, and whatnot. I've heard stories from TV shows and from my mom from things she expireced when she was young, and what she knows about the land we live on.<br>
        Fun fact, my house is on Indian Burial Grounds. Another Fun Fact, when the properties between my family's and my neighbor's were connected, the man who previously owned the land had a barn. His wife died, and not long after he commited suicide in the barn. I never dared to go near or inside that barn when I was little, it always gave me a spooky vibe. I guess that's why.<br> 
        Anyways, why I don't sleep with the light on.<br>
        Around the time I was in 7th grade, when I DID sleep with the light on. I woke up to the feeling of something watching me - because that's always fun. I looked around in the dark before seeing a large, looming shadow in the corner of my room. Staring at me. I haven't felt panic like I had that night, and never have I rocketed out of bed faster to turn on the light. Something about it just terrified me.<br>
        I've had strange expirences since then, but they've never caused me that level of fear.</p>

        <h2 id="Story-4">Jade, A Pupper Doggo</h2>
        <h6>Sept 16, 2016</h6>
        <img src="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=80395b6395&attid=0.1&permmsgid=msg-a:r-30137246554310299&th=16d8344494536e82&view=fimg&sz=s0-l75-ft&attbid=ANGjdJ8D-TYQGKj7afdpMwf2gpjdD24S79FfR_G90QYodeUaxuKTKCvC95a5U16HI7sG9PclC9ajI2w4AjkQnSCUksvKinoJL4zwUUA89RZRhr6_vLmK3YcYpBV-_KY&disp=emb&realattid=16d83443790a029b4f41" alt="picture of the pupper" width=400>
        <p>I met my dog, Jade, on September 16th, 2016. She was just 6 weeks old, her litter and mother had been sold out from under her and she was a lone puppy. The person that had her previously was going to drown her before we rescued her. Jade's a Boston Terrier/Chihuahua mix, also known as Spaz Incarnate. She's an anxious little dog, over protective at times but she's nice as long as you give her time to warm up to you.<br>
        It's been three years since we got her, and her and I are just about attached at the hip. She follows me around like a shadow at home, occaisionally bouncing off the walls or barking at nothing.<br>
        She's pretty anxious, as I said. She'll shake and bark when someone comes up to our house. It takes a lot to calm her down, but out of everyone at my house, she calms the easiest with me. Jade always sleeps with me at night, either on my pillow in a protective manner, or under the blankets by my stomach. She also loves squeaky toys, and has a talent for murdering them in about five minutes.</p>
